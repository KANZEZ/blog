# The Unscented Kalman Filter for Nonlinear Estimation

>When I did a interview yesterday, the interviewer asked me about the difference about Kalman Filter(KF) and Extend Kalman Filter(EKF), I answered: basiclly KF deals with linear system, and EKF can deal with nonlinear system by linearizing it, then he asked me what if some systems has strong nonlinearity so that it's not appropriate to directly linearize it, my first thought is to add higher order terms to approxiamte the nonlinearity, after the second thoughts, this is not appropriate also since the whole KF(EKF) rely on the assumption that the random variables are Gaussian and linearly transform a gaussian can still give us a gaussian, that's how KF algorithm came from, so by using higher order approxiamte the rule obviously doesn't be obeied anymore. The second reason is using "second-order" versoin of EKF exist, but largely increase the complexity and time cost. So it's time to introduce another KF based algorithm, UKF [[ref](https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/unscented.pdf)], to solve the problem, let's talk about it.   
>Note: about the math behind KF/EKF, see the post (stay tune), the truth is, under the setting of KF/EKF, it can always provide the optimal minimum mean-squared error. 


## Intro: Current flaw of EKF
In the prediction step of EKF, it follows the nonlinear function of the prior mean value for estimates, however, the covariance are determined by linearing the nonlinearity, then determining the posterior covariance analytically using the measurement update step in KF. So in this step, what EKF does is to provide a first-order approximation of the optimal term, which will introduce large error, sub-optimal, and divergence. The UKF amended this flaw and still within the same time complexity of EKF.

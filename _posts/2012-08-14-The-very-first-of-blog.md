# The Very First of My Blog

>Starting today (2024-11-06), I've decided to write my own technical blog. Wish me luck!


# Why writing blog ?

I believe blogging is essential for both personal growth as a developer/researcher and for contributing to the community. Writing a blog offers several benefits:

* It helps me clarify my thoughts.
* It solidifies my knowledge.
* It aids others who want to learn.

I'm a master student with a keen interest in robotics, particularly in motion planning, control, and robot learning. As I dive deeper into these fields, I’ve realized how vast and interconnected the knowledge and technology are. Keeping track of everything I learn from courses, research projects, and papers has become increasingly challenging. Lately, I’ve felt a bit lost in this “sea of tech.” 

By "keeping track," I mean two things: (1) understanding the big picture of these fields, such as identifying key and promising technologies, and (2) knowing my own skills. While I’ve gained knowledge in areas from planning to control, optimization to deep learning, and soft robotics to multi-robot systems, I often feel I’m losing parts along the way. I find myself forgetting concepts I learned just days ago, repeating coding mistakes, or struggling to explain intricate algorithm details even if I thought I understood them.

To address this, I believe the best solution is to write things down. Writing forces clarity—if I can clearly write, code, or explain something, I know I’ve truly learned it. While blogging takes time, I’m convinced it’s worth the effort.


# What included in my blog ?

I plan to write three main types of blog posts:
* Posts that solidify and expand my expertise
* Research paper reviews
* Other topics (to be decided)

Initially, I’ll focus on using the blog to clarify my understanding by writing down, coding, and explaining algorithms and theories I’ve learned. I hope to reach a level of mastery where I can confidently answer interview questions or discuss these topics in depth. Since I also intend to pursue a PhD in robotics, I’ll review classical/most resent and interesting papers in relevant fields.

More specifically, I’ll cover the following topics/tags (for now):
* planning
* control
* planning with learning
* control with learning
* multi agent planning 
* multi agent control
* deep learning
* reinforcement learning
* Data structure and algorithms(focus on leetcode problems) 
* coding tricks and experience sharing
* fun math

The content may come from homework assignments, new concepts I’ve learned, course or research projects, coding problems I’ve encountered, technical challenges I’ve solved, or intriguing papers.
